The Forest Fire Detection System is a project leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect the presence or initiation of forest fires in images. This model aims to analyze aerial surveillance footage of forests in real-time, enabling timely alerts in case of fires. Trained on a dataset containing around 6000 images categorized as "fire," "no fire," and "start a fire," the system distinguishes between visible flames, smoke indicating a fire's onset, and forest scenes without fire. Additional "start fire" images were incorporated by extracting frames from videos to improve classification accuracy. Data augmentation techniques, including random transformations like zooms, shifts, crops, and rotations, were applied to ensure robust generalization.

The project employs a well-organized structure. Key modules include setup_datasets.py for dataset preparation, transfer_learning.py for defining and training the transfer learning model using InceptionV3, and video_annotation.py for annotating video frames with CNN predictions. Additional modules like evaluate_model.py enable model evaluation, while launcher.py provides a command-line interface for tasks such as training, fine-tuning, predicting, and extracting hard-to-classify examples. The pre-trained model, stored as transfer_learned_model.h5, achieves impressive performance metrics, with a test set accuracy of 91% and an overall dataset accuracy of 99%. The project has been tested with libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

Users can train the model using specified datasets and parameters, fine-tune pre-trained models, make predictions on individual images, and annotate videos to detect fires in real time. Video examples demonstrating the system's capability to annotate fire presence in frames highlight its practical applications. While the model achieves high accuracy for "fire" and "no fire" categories, "start fire" images pose a greater challenge due to overlaps in smoke characteristics and small flame visibility. Overall, this project showcases a practical approach to forest fire detection, with potential real-world applications in environmental monitoring and disaster management.
